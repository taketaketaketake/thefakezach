I recently stumbled upon [this research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.14351), and it confirms what I intuitively think about multi-agent systems.

👉🏾 **You have to design a multi-agent system built for your use case.**

It's not enough to simply build a single multi-purpose agent or even a multi-agent system that lacks a governance system.

Multi-agent infrastructure allows for complexity, and more importantly, **correctness** in your outputs.

The paper highlights what many of us building AI systems are discovering: specialized agents working together under a proper governance framework outperform monolithic agents trying to do everything.

When you build a multi-agent system tailored to your specific domain:
- Each agent can focus on what it does best
- You get better error handling through agent specialization
- Governance ensures consistency across the system
- Outputs are more reliable and correct

This isn't just theory—it's the difference between building AI systems that work okay sometimes and building systems that consistently deliver value.
