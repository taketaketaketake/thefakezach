      summary: "A comprehensive business discovery platform connecting Detroit's local community with neighborhood businesses through interactive maps, verified data, and social engagement features.",
      problem: "Detroit's diverse business ecosystem lacked a unified platform for discovery and community engagement. Existing solutions were either too generic, missing cannabis compliance features, or didn't provide the social interaction that builds local connections.",

      problem: "Michigan homeowners struggle to find trustworthy HVAC contractors and fair pricing, often facing expensive repairs without knowing if they're being overcharged or need professional help.",
      solution: "Built a robust, multi-funnel lead generation platform that drives homeowners into the right pathway based on intent — from photo-based furnace diagnosis to high-intent repair funnels. The system includes a $125 professional assessment flow, real contract-backed pricing transparency, automated lead routing, and a vetted statewide contractor network.

      problem: "Most introductory coding tools feel rigid, uninspired, or too abstract — especially for young kids. I wanted something more personal: a way for my own kids to learn the fundamentals of programming while also getting hands-on exposure to modern AI tools and creative technology.",
      solution: "Cosmic Crew started as a hands-on project for me and my kids — a way for all of us to explore new creative and technical tools together. In building the first version, I learned generative AI workflows (ComfyUI locally), character design, 3D environments, and Three.js fundamentals. The result is a simple interactive prototype where kids can direct a rocket through space using basic movement commands. More than a finished platform, it's an ongoing learning project that helps us experiment with coding, creativity, and modern AI tools side by side.",
